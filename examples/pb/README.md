# Generated Protocol Buffer Code

This directory contains generated code from `.proto` files.

## File Naming Convention

- `*.pb.go` - Generated by `protoc-gen-go` (protocol buffer messages) **DO NOT EDIT**
- `*.connect.go` - Generated by `protoc-gen-connect` (RPC handlers) **DO NOT EDIT**
- `*_aggregate.pb.go` - Generated by `protoc-gen-eventsourcing` (aggregate boilerplate) **DO NOT EDIT**
- `*_client.pb.go` - Generated by `protoc-gen-eventsourcing` (client SDK) **DO NOT EDIT**
- `*_handler.pb.go` - Generated by `protoc-gen-eventsourcing` (handler interfaces) **DO NOT EDIT**
- `*_server.pb.go` - Generated by `protoc-gen-eventsourcing` (server wiring) **DO NOT EDIT**
- `*_sdk.pb.go` - Generated by `protoc-gen-eventsourcing` (SDK methods) **DO NOT EDIT**

## Hand-Written Files

Files WITHOUT `.pb.go` or `.connect.go` suffixes are **HAND-WRITTEN** and must be maintained by developers:

- `account/v1/account_appliers.go` - Implements event applier methods for Account aggregate

### Why are appliers in the `pb/` directory?

Due to Go's type system, you cannot add methods to types from other packages. Since `AccountAggregate` is defined in package `accountv1`, the applier methods MUST also be in `package accountv1`.

This is a standard Go pattern when extending generated protocol buffer types.

### Guidelines for Hand-Written Code

1. **Naming:** Never use `.pb.go` suffix for hand-written files
2. **Comments:** Add clear headers indicating the file is hand-written
3. **Minimal:** Keep these files as thin as possible - delegate complex logic to `domain/` package
4. **Separation:** Put business rules in `../bankaccount/domain/` when possible

## Regenerating Code

```bash
# From examples directory
buf generate
```

This will regenerate all `*.pb.go`, `*.connect.go`, and other generated files.
Hand-written `*.go` files (without special suffixes) will NOT be deleted.
